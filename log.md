# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2017-01-03

**Today's Progress**: My first project is a static site generator service that allows me to post blogs to static sites as well as send tweets, make Facebook posts, Instagram posts(Very hard as this is supported in a public API). I am going to write it all in Elixir.

**Thoughts** I program for my day job so I know this is going to be hard.
